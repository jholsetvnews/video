Ball has pounded his way through the featherweight division and now makes his second defense of the WBA strap he first won against Raymond Ford last June. On the end of something of a robbery against Rey Vargas in November 2023 for the WBC title, a fight many believe the Scouser won, the Wrecking Ball has devastating power and squeezes 5ft 2in of pure muscle into the 126lbs limit. He'll got on the front foot and look for an early stoppage to set up a super-fight with undisputed super bantamweight champion, and pound-for-pound king, Naoya Inoue.

While Ball and Doheny are themselves brilliant fighters, the England vs Ireland angle adds another layer of excitement of the bout. Ball won the featherweight title in June last year and then defended it in October.

While Doheny is well past his peak, he would want to show the world that he still has got the fight in. The odds are stacked up against him but the Irishman would want to give it all.

Doheny, stopped by Inoue in the seventh round of their world title fight last September, is moving up a division as he seeks a big upset. The 38-year-old Irishman has criticized "numpties in boxing" for overlooking him in the fight and will hope to use his reach advantage to box at range and stay out of Ball's power punches to the body. A wily veteran who held the IBF super bantamweight world title from 2018 to 2019, the Power will need the performance of a lifetime.

Uncrowned has Nick Ball vs. TJ Doheny live results, round-by-round updates, highlights, ring walks and start time for the Ball vs. Doheny fight card on Saturday afternoon at the M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool, United Kingdom. Ball defends his WBA featherweight world title against Doheny in a Britain vs. Ireland clash.

Ball (21-0-1, 12 KOs) claimed the title with a controversial split decision victory over Raymond Ford as part of the Queensberry vs. Matchroom 5 vs. 5 card this past June. The Liverpudlian has since made one defense of his belt, a 10th-round TKO stoppage of Ronny Rios in October.

Doheny (26-5, 20 KOs) previously held the unified WBA and IBF super bantamweight crown until he dropped the titles to Daniel Roman in 2019. Dohney then lost three more times in his next five fights, which many expected to be the end of his run at the top level, however the Irishman experienced an unexpected career resurgence in Japan.

The 28-year-old's relentlessness in the ring normally contrasts with a calm demeanour on the other side of the ropes, but veteran Irish southpaw Doheny has been on the wind-up all week and the pair clashed angrily at Friday's weigh-in.

Ball, who has established himself as one of the standout fighters in the featherweight division, had previously challenged WBC featherweight champion Ray Vargas in Saudi Arabia last year, resulting in a draw after he impressively scored two knockdowns. He bounced back successfully just three months later by winning the WBA title against Raymond Ford, securing victory with a 2-1 decision at the same event where he was part of the high-stakes light heavyweight unification fight between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol.

The 28-year-old British fighter holds an impressive record of 21 wins, 12 of which are by knockout, with just one draw and no losses to his name. His aggressive fighting style and height of 157 cm have made him popular among fans, earning him the support of Hall of Fame promoter Frank Warren. The upcoming fight marks Ball's second title defense after successfully defeating Ryan Walsh by TKO last October in Liverpool.

On the other side of the ring, 38-year-old TJ Doheny is also no stranger to challenges at the highest level. The former IBF world super bantamweight champion has faced elite competition, including Naoya Inuoe, to whom he lost by TKO earlier this season. Despite Doheny's record featuring 26 wins and 20 knockouts against 5 losses, his recent performance against Inuoe showed promise, as he managed to put up a decent fight before succumbing to injury.

Doheny, 38, picked up three wins in a row over Japanese contenders following that slump, which earned him a shot at Naoya Inoue's undisputed championship this past September. Doheny extended Inoue into the second half of the fight but was forced to pull out with a back injury during the seventh round.

The fight is expected to draw considerable attention, particularly due to the speculation surrounding future matchups, including the potential clash between Ball and Inuoe later this year. Promoter Turki Alalshik has hinted at ambitious plans aiming for Ball to challenge Inuoe, who has been making waves since moving up to the featherweight division. Ball's impressive training sessions and fighting spirit have also been evident as he prepares for yet another challenge.sdfghfdsdf
