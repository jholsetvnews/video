Sitting in fifth place, City hold a narrow one-point lead over their in-form visitors. With the title race slipping further out of reach, Pep Guardiola's side are now firmly focused on securing Champions League qualification.

Brighton, on the other hand, have bounced back in style after their humbling 7-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest, stringing together four consecutive league wins. Fabian Hurzeler's men have shown the resilience that has defined their campaign, and they will travel to Manchester full of belief that they can take all three points.

The title may be decided, and the relegation battle is nearly wrapped up, but the real drama is unfolding in the race for Champions League qualification! With nearly every team in the top half still in the hunt for a crucial top-five finish, the stakes couldn't be higher.

Man City are the favorites behind Liverpool and Arsenal, but they continue to struggle. Pep Guardiola's side looked devoid of ideas against Nottm Forest last time out. They will have plenty of possession when they face Brighton, but Man City must do a better job of creating clear-cut chances.

Only Liverpool have scored in more matches than Brighton in 24/25, so Fabian Hurzeler's men will fancy their chances of finding the net. Brighton are a brave team and they will take the game to Man City, so this promises to be an entertaining encounter.

Manchester City team news

City boss Pep Guardiola is facing a selection headache with several key names missing. Nathan Ak√© is set for an extended spell on the sidelines, ruled out for up to 11 weeks, while John Stones, Rodri, Oscar Bobb, and Manuel Akanji also remain unavailable. However, there is optimism that Kevin De Bruyne, Mateo Kovaƒçiƒá, and Omar Marmoush could return after sitting out the recent clash with Nottingham Forest.

Brighton team news

Brighton will be boosted by the return of Tariq Lamptey from suspension, while there is hope that Lewis Dunk, Joel Veltman, and Matt O'Riley could be fit in time. However, Jason Steele, Ferdi Kadioglu, James Milner, and Igor are all expected to remain sidelined.

The hosts find themselves in fifth in the standings after last weekend's damaging 1-0 defeat to Champions League qualification rivals Nottingham Forest, with that result meaning City have lost three of their last five EPL fixtures.

They come up against an in-form Brighton team currently in seventh who come into this match off the back of a last-gasp 2-1 victory over Fulham which made it four wins on the spin for the Seagulls.
