Nick Ball vs TJ Doheny live stream: start time, The Nick Ball vs TJ Doheny live stream for the former's WBA featherweight title has been simmering nicely and could explode on Saturday night. Below we have all the info on how to watch Ball vs Doheny from anywhere, with details on worldwide TV channels, broadcasters and start times.

Ball has pounded his way through the featherweight division and now makes his second defense of the WBA strap he first won against Raymond Ford last June. On the end of something of a robbery against Rey Vargas in November 2023 for the WBC title, a fight many believe the Scouser won, the Wrecking Ball has devastating power and squeezes 5ft 2in of pure muscle into the 126lbs limit. He'll got on the front foot and look for an early stoppage to set up a super-fight with undisputed super bantamweight champion, and pound-for-pound king, Naoya Inoue.

Doheny, stopped by Inoue in the seventh round of their world title fight last September, is moving up a division as he seeks a big upset. The 38-year-old Irishman has criticized "numpties in boxing" for overlooking him in the fight and will hope to use his reach advantage to box at range and stay out of Ball's power punches to the body. A wily veteran who held the IBF super bantamweight world title from 2018 to 2019, the Power will need the performance of a lifetime.

Read on below for how to watch Ball vs Doheny live streams online and from anywhere, as well as details about the start time and the undercard.

The Nick Ball vs. TJ Doheny main card airs at 6:30 p.m. local time. Ball and Doheny should make their way to the ring around 10 p.m. GMT, depending on how long the undercard fights last.

Liverpool's Ball (21-0-1) beat Isaac Dogboe and fought Rey Vargas to a draw in a WBC featherweight title fight. Following the Vargas fight, he looked impressive against Raymond Ford, beating him in June for the WBA title. The 28-year-old followed up that performance by dropping Ronny Rios multiple times in October.

Doheny (26-5, 20 KOs) previously held the unified WBA and IBF super bantamweight crown until he dropped the titles to Daniel Roman in 2019. Dohney then lost three more times in his next five fights, which many expected to be the end of his run at the top level, however the Irishman experienced an unexpected career resurgence in Japan.

Doheny, 38, picked up three wins in a row over Japanese contenders following that slump, which earned him a shot at Naoya Inoue's undisputed championship this past September. Doheny extended Inoue into the second half of the fight but was forced to pull out with a back injury during the seventh round.

Ball vs. Doheny begins at 2:30 p.m. ET on DAZN, with main event ring walks expected at 6:15 p.m. ET.
